# Solaropoly Strategy Game
In this game, you'll each take the role of a solar energy startup competing for space to set up your solar farms, factories and grids across the globe. 

Starting the game with an investment of Green Energy Tokens provided by the United Nations for the project, the goal is to maximise energy production among all companies and reach a target solar power output within  a given number of turns - so compete and collaborate wisely.

But also, the player whose power increase tips the total energy capture over the target recieves a legendary commemorative ScamCoin! 

You can increase power output by buying areas with basic facilities, completing sets of complementary facilities in regions (vertical integration of operations), and developing those completed sets. You'll be able to trade with other players to complete sets, start development and increase your individual and collective chances of hitting the target.
